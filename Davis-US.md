As a user, I want to select items from a list of similarly valued items, so that I can exchange my item for one that provides better value to me.

As a user, I want to like items, so that I can display interest in an item without actually trading for it.

As a user, I want to receive email notifications for items that Iâ€™ve traded, so that I know when my item will be shipped and delivered.
