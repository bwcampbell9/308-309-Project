As a user, I want to input a request (to another user) to trade an item, so that I can trade it in for an item that provides better value to me.

As a user, I want to create a closet of items that I want to trade, so that other users can see my closet and potentially barter for items within it.

As a user, I want to like items in another userâ€™s closet, so that I can display interest in an item without actually trading for it.
